# Railway-Track-Allocation-System
This project aims to give an efficient railway route grid of a given area that which includes lists of cities, geographical features such as water bodies, forests, savannah, seashores, etc represented by a 2D Array. Our task is to connect the above-mentioned places through railway lines using the minimum resources for final implementation by the government of the area.

Need for this project is due to high construction costs and budget constraints in India, it is more efficient to increase connectivity of all major metropolitan cities using minimum resources.

Algorithms Used:
A* algorithm, self-made algorithms, Dynamic Programming (DP), Backtracking, Memoization, Depth first search (DFS)
